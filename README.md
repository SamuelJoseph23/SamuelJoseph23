## About Me

I'm a developer and researcher with a deep interest in machine learning, security, game development and full-stack development. My work focuses on building intelligent systems that prioritize both performance and security, particularly at the intersection of quantum-safe cryptography and explainable AI.

## Featured Projects

### Security & Cryptography
**[Quantum-Safe Hybrid ML](https://github.com/SamuelJoseph23/quantum-safe-hybrid-ml)**  
A research project implementing post-quantum homomorphic encryption for machine learning on sensitive datasets. This addresses the growing concern of quantum computing threats to current encryption standards.

**[Automated Security Code Review](https://github.com/SamuelJoseph23/automated-security-code-review)**  
An intelligent tool that uses machine learning, pattern matching, and abstract syntax tree analysis to automatically detect security vulnerabilities in codebases.

### Machine Learning & NLP
**[BERT Emotion Pipeline](https://github.com/SamuelJoseph23/bert-emotion-pipeline)**  
A deep learning system that detects emotions in text using LSTM neural networks, designed for applications in sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.

**[Language Detection NLP Pipeline](https://github.com/SamuelJoseph23/language-detection-nlp-pipeline)**  
Multilingual language detection system with comprehensive text preprocessing, tokenization, and classification capabilities.

**[ML XAI Pipeline](https://github.com/SamuelJoseph23/ml-xai-pipeline)**  
An end-to-end pipeline focused on explainable AI, providing transparency in model decisions through feature importance analysis and interpretable outputs.

### Full-Stack Development
**[University Internship Management Portal](https://github.com/SamuelJoseph23/University-Internship-Management-Portal)**  
A complete web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing university internship processes, student applications, and administrative workflows.

**[DBMS Project](https://github.com/SamuelJoseph23/DBMS_Project)**  
Database management system developed with C# and MySQL, demonstrating practical database design and implementation.

### Creative Tools
**[MIDITypist](https://github.com/SamuelJoseph23/MIDITypist)**  
A Windows application that maps MIDI inputs to keyboard actions, enabling musicians and creators to automate workflows and explore new creative possibilities.
